save_as: index.html

Hey, I'm Shahid! I'm a junior-year computer engineering student at The University of Texas at Austin.

I currently intern with the Office of the CTO at the Server Architecture and Technologies team at Dell EMC. I'm also an investor with Contrary Capital.

My current interests are machine learning, startups and entrepreneurship, religion, and blues music. I love hiking and backpacking, and (try to) play guitar on occasion.

[Here]({filename}/downloads/resume.pdf) is my resume.
