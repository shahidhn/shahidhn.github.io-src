Hey, I'm Shahid! I'm a junior-year computer engineering student at The University of Texas at Austin, a Venture Partner with Contrary Capital, and a current Dell EMC intern.

I believe that the overlap of technology and business carries the power to bring abundance to the world. I'm interested in machine learning and AI's impact on society; entrepreneurship, startups, and venture capital; and the history of religion and society.
