Hey, I'm Shahid! I'm a junior-year computer engineering student at The University of Texas at Austin, a Venture Partner with Contrary Capital, and a current Dell EMC intern.

I believe that the overlap of technology and business carries the power to bring abundance to the world. I'm interested in machine learning and AI's impact on society; entrepreneurship, startups, and venture capital; and the history of religion and society.

**I'm on a lookout for full-time software engineering (systems and application layers) and machine learning positions starting June 2019!** [Here]({filename}/downloads/resume.pdf) is my resume. You can reach me at [shahidhn@utexas.edu](mailto:shahidhn@utexas.edu), or through the various links in the sidebar.
