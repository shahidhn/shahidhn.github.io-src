### All-time favorite performances

Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a huge John Mayer fan, and I think this performance (do watch the entire concert - Rock in Rio, 2013 - if possible) is him at his best: striking that perfect balance between technical proficiency and raw emotion. Pardon the all-too-audible crowd and on-screen lyrics, but the ending solo is worth the wait - so incredibly soulful.
